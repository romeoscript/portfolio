                 Romanus's journey into technology began with borrowed resources and determination. Without a 
                 laptop or smartphone, he constantly borrowed his cousin's phone to research and study coding. 
                 He taught himself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using SoloLearn, studying until the battery died, 
                 then waiting for it to charge. This experience shaped his foundational approach: identify the 
                 blocker, find a solution, then execute.

                At Nanocodes, where he served as Lead Frontend Engineer, Romanus shaped both product and people. 
                He led development of the company's flagship Learning Management System (TechVerve), serving hundreds 
                of students, and built their online marketplace and blog, establishing the technical foundation that 
                still powers their business today.

                 Beyond engineering, he worked with marketing teams to shape acquisition funnels, setting up analytics,

                 mentored. In 2022, he organized trips to GDG DevFest Enugu so students could meet real practitioners 
                 and see how the industry works. His impact extends beyond company walls—he contributes to open-source 
                 infrastructure and has established himself as a voice in the digital technology community.

                 Hackathon, serving as a frontend engineer for Team GETO AI. These experiences reinforced his belief 
                 that his value isn't just in the code he writes—it's in the infrastructure he contributes to, the 
                 developers he mentors, and the knowledge he shares.
